    <question>Your company produces 20,000 files every hour. Each data file is formatted as a comma separated values (CSV) file that is less than 4 KB. All files must be ingested on Google Cloud Platform before they can be processed. Your company site has a 200 ms latency to Google Cloud, and your Internet connection bandwidth is limited as 50 Mbps. You currently deploy a secure FTP (SFTP) server on a virtual machine in Google Compute Engine as the data ingestion point. A local SFTP client runs on a dedicated machine to transmit the CSV files as is. The goal is to make reports with data from the previous day available to the executives by 10:00 a.m. each day. This design is barely able to keep up with the current volume, even though the bandwidth utilization is rather low. You are told that due to seasonality, your company expects the number of files to double for the next three months. Which two actions should you take? (choose two.)</question>

    <question>You operate a database that stores stock trades and an application that retrieves average stock price for a given company over an adjustable window of time. The data is stored in Cloud Bigtable where the datetime of the stock trade is the beginning of the row key. Your application has thousands of concurrent users, and you notice that performance is starting to degrade as more stocks are added. What should you do to improve the performance of your application?</question>

    <question>You are implementing several batch jobs that must be executed on a schedule. These jobs have many interdependent steps that must be executed in a specific order. Portions of the jobs involve executing shell scripts, running Hadoop jobs, and running queries in BigQuery. The jobs are expected to run for many minutes up to several hours. If the steps fail, they must be retried a fixed number of times. Which service should you use to manage the execution of these jobs?</question>

    <question>You need to compose visualization for operations teams with the following requirements:
- Telemetry must include data from all 50,000 installations for the most recent 6 weeks (sampling once every minute)
- The report must not be more than 3 hours delayed from live data.
- The actionable report should only show suboptimal links.
- Most suboptimal links should be sorted to the top.
- Suboptimal links can be grouped and filtered by regional geography.
- User response time to load the report must be less than 5 seconds.

You create a data source to store the last 6 weeks of data, and create visualizations that allow viewers to see multiple date ranges, distinct geographic regions, and unique installation types. You always show the latest data without any changes to your visualizations. You want to avoid creating and updating new visualizations each month. What should you do?</question>
