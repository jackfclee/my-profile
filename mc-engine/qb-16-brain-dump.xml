Your startup has never implemented a formal security policy. Currently, everyone in the company has access to the datasets stored in Google BigQuery. Teams have freedom to use the service as they see fit, and they have not documented their use cases. You have been asked to secure the data warehouse. You need to discover what everyone is doing. What should you do first?</question>

    <question>Your company is running their first dynamic campaign, serving different offers by analyzing real-time data during the holiday season. The data scientists are collecting terabytes of data that rapidly grows every hour during their 30-day campaign. They are using Google Cloud Dataflow to preprocess the data and collect the feature (signals) data that is needed for the machine learning model in Google Cloud Bigtable.

Your company produces 20,000 files every hour. Each data file is formatted as a comma separated values (CSV) file that is less than 4 KB. All files must be ingested on Google Cloud Platform before they can be processed. Your company site has a 200 ms latency to Google Cloud, and your Internet connection bandwidth is limited as 50 Mbps. You currently deploy a secure FTP (SFTP) server on a virtual machine in Google Compute Engine as the data ingestion point. A local SFTP client runs on a dedicated machine to transmit the CSV files as is. The goal is to make reports with data from the previous day available to the executives by 10:00 a.m. each day. This design is barely able to keep up with the current volume, even though the bandwidth utilization is rather low.

    <question>9

You’ve migrated a Hadoop job from an on-prem cluster to dataproc and GCS. Your Spark job is a complicated analytical workload that consists of many shuffing operations and initial data are parquet files (on average
200-400 MB size each). You see some degradation in performance after the migration to Dataproc, so you’d like to optimize for it. You need to keep in mind that your organization is very cost-sensitive, so you’d like to continue using Dataproc on preemptibles (with 2 non-preemptible workers only) for this workload.

You are implementing several batch jobs that must be executed on a schedule. These jobs have many interdependent steps that must be executed in a specific order. Portions of the jobs involve executing shell scripts, running Hadoop jobs, and running queries in BigQuery. The jobs are expected to run for many minutes up to several hours. If the steps fail, they must be retried a fixed number of times. Which service should you use to manage the execution of these jobs?</question>
