The data is heavily structured, and your data science team will build machine learning models based on this data. You want to maximize performance and usability for your data science team. Which two strategies should you adopt? Choose 2 answers.
A. Denormalize the data as must as possible.
B. Preserve the structure of the data as much as possible.
C. Use BigQuery UPDATE to further reduce the size of the dataset.
D. Develop a data pipeline where status updates are appended to BigQuery instead of updated. E. Copy a daily snapshot of transaction data to Cloud Storage and store it as an Avro fil
F. Use BigQuery’ssupport for external data sources to query.

You are operating a Cloud Dataflow streaming pipeline. The pipeline aggregates events from a Cloud Pub/Sub subscription source, within a window, and sinks the resulting aggregation to a Cloud Storage bucket. The source has consistent throughput. You want to monitor an alert on behavior of the pipeline with Cloud Stackdriver to ensure that it is processing data. Which Stackdriver alerts should you create?
A. An alert based on a decrease of subscription/num_undelivered_messages for the source and a rate of change increase of instance/storage/used_bytes for the


destination
B. An alert based on an increase of subscription/num_undelivered_messages for the source and a rate of change decrease of instance/storage/used_bytes for the destination
C. An alert based on a decrease of instance/storage/used_bytes for the source and a rate of change increase of subscription/num_undelivered_messages for the destination
D. An alert based on an increase of instance/storage/used_bytes for the source and a rate of change decrease of subscription/num_undelivered_messages for the destination

You’ve migrated a Hadoop job from an on-prem cluster to dataproc and GCS. Your Spark job is a complicated analytical workload that consists of many shuffing operations and initial data are parquet files (on average
200-400 MB size each). You see some degradation in performance after the migration to Dataproc, so you’d like to optimize for it. You need to keep in mind that your organization is very cost-sensitive, so you’d like to continue using Dataproc on preemptibles (with 2 non-preemptible workers only) for this workload.
What should you do?
A. Increase the size of your parquet files to ensure them to be 1 GB minimum.
B. Switch to TFRecords formats (app
C. 200MB per file) instead of parquet files.
D. Switch from HDDs to SSDs, copy initial data from GCS to HDFS, run the Spark job and copy results back to GCS. E. Switch from HDDs to SSDs, override the preemptible VMs configuration to increase the boot disk size.

You use BigQuery as your centralized analytics platform. New data is loaded every day, and an ETL pipeline modifies the original data and prepares it for the final users. This ETL pipeline is regularly modified and can generate errors, but sometimes the errors are detected only after 2 weeks. You need to provide a method to recover from these errors, and your backups should be optimized for storage costs. How should you organize your data in BigQuery and store your backups?
A. Organize your data in a single table, export, and compress and store the BigQuery data in Cloud Storage.
B. Organize your data in separate tables for each month, and export, compress, and store the data in Cloud Storage.
C. Organize your data in separate tables for each month, and duplicate your data on a separate dataset in BigQuery.


D. Organize your data in separate tables for each month, and use snapshot decorators to restore the table to a time prior to the corruption.

How should you change your ETL process to carry out sensor calibration systematically in the future?
A. Modify the transformMapReduce jobs to apply sensor calibration before they do anything else.
B. Introduce a new MapReduce job to apply sensor calibration to raw data, and ensure all other MapReduce jobs are chained after this.
