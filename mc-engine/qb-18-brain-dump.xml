    <question>You have spent a few days loading data from comma-separated values (CSV) files into the Google BigQuery table CLICK_STREAM. The column DT stores the epoch time of click events. For convenience, you chose a simple schema where every field is treated as the STRING type. Now, you want to compute web session durations of users who visit your site, and you want to change its data type to the TIMESTAMP. You want to minimize the migration effort without making future queries computationally expensive. What should you do?</question>

Your company is currently setting up data pipelines for their campaign. For all the Google Cloud Pub/Sub streaming data, one of the important business requirements is to be able to periodically identify the inputs and their timings during their campaign. Engineers have decided to use windowing and transformation in Google Cloud Dataflow for this purpose. However, when testing this feature, they find that the Cloud Dataflow job fails for the all streaming insert. What is the most likely cause of this problem?</question>

You need to choose a database to store time series CPU and memory usage for millions of computers. You need to store this data in one-second interval samples. Analysts will be performing real-time, ad hoc analytics against the database. You want to avoid being charged for every query executed and ensure that the schema design will allow for future growth of the dataset. Which database and data model should you choose?</question>

    <question>1

You want to build a managed Hadoop system as your data lake. The data transformation process is composed of a series of Hadoop jobs executed in sequence. To accomplish the design of separating storage from compute, you decided to use the Cloud Storage connector to store all input data, output data, and intermediary data. However, you noticed that one Hadoop job runs very slowly with Cloud Dataproc, when compared with the on-premises bare-metal Hadoop environment (8-core nodes with 100-GB RAM). Analysis shows that this particular Hadoop job is disk I/O intensive. You want to resolve the issue. What should you do?</question>
