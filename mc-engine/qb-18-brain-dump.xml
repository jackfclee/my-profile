    <question>You have spent a few days loading data from comma-separated values (CSV) files into the Google BigQuery table CLICK_STREAM. The column DT stores the epoch time of click events. For convenience, you chose a simple schema where every field is treated as the STRING type.

You want to minimize the migration effort without making future queries computationally expensive. What should you do?</question>

You are deploying a new storage system for your mobile application, which is a media streaming service. You decide the best fit is Google Cloud Datastore. You have entities with multiple properties, some of which can take on multiple values. For example, in the entity ‘Movie’ the property ‘actors’ and the property ‘tags’ have multiple values but the property ‘date released’ does not. A typical query would ask for all movies with actor=<actorname> ordered by date_released or all movies with tag=Comedy ordered by date_released. How should you avoid a combinatorial explosion in the number of indexes?

    <question>81

You want to build a managed Hadoop system as your data lake. The data transformation process is composed of a series of Hadoop jobs executed in sequence. To accomplish the design of separating storage from compute, you decided to use the Cloud Storage connector to store all input data, output data, and intermediary data. However, you noticed that one Hadoop job runs very slowly with Cloud Dataproc, when compared with the on-premises bare-metal Hadoop environment (8-core nodes with 100-GB RAM). Analysis shows that this particular Hadoop job is disk I/O intensive. You want to resolve the issue. What should you do?</question>

You are migrating your data warehouse to Google Cloud and decommissioning your on-premises data center Because this is a priority for your company, you know that bandwidth will be made available for the initial data load to the cloud. The files being transferred are not large in number, but each file is 90 GB Additionally, you want your transactional systems to continually update the warehouse on Google Cloud in real time What tools should you use to migrate the data and ensure that it continues to write to your warehouse?</question>
