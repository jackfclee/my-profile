    <question>Your startup has never implemented a formal security policy. Currently, everyone in the company has access to the datasets stored in Google BigQuery. Teams have freedom to use the service as they see fit, and they have not documented their use cases. You have been asked to secure the data warehouse. You need to discover what everyone is doing. What should you do first?</question>

    <question>You are designing a basket abandonment system for an ecommerce company. The system will send a message to a user based on these rules:
No interaction by the user on the site for 1 hour
Has added more than $30 worth of products to the basket
Has not completed a transaction
You use Google Cloud Dataflow to process the data and decide if a message should be sent. How should you design the pipeline?</question>

Flowlogistic is rolling out their real-time inventory tracking system. The tracking devices will all send package-tracking messages, which will now go to a single Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic instead of the Apache Kafka cluster. A subscriber application will then process the messages for real-time reporting and store them in Google BigQuery for historical analysis.

    <question>7

Your company produces 20,000 files every hour. Each data file is formatted as a comma separated values (CSV) file that is less than 4 KB. All files must be ingested on Google Cloud Platform before they can be processed. Your company site has a 200 ms latency to Google Cloud, and your Internet connection bandwidth is limited as 50 Mbps. You currently deploy a secure FTP (SFTP) server on a virtual machine in Google Compute Engine as the data ingestion point. A local SFTP client runs on a dedicated machine to transmit the CSV files as is. The goal is to make reports with data from the previous day available to the executives by 10:00 a.m. each day. This design is barely able to keep up with the current volume, even though the bandwidth utilization is rather low.

          <detail>Create an embedding column</detail>
        </option>
      </options>
    </answer>Answer:  D

There are two problems with one-hot encoding. First, it has high dimensionality, meaning that instead of having just one value, like a continuous feature, it has many values, or dimensions. This makes computation more time-consuming, especially if a feature has a very large number of categories. The second problem is that it doesn’t encode any relationships between the categories. They are completely independent from each other, so the network has no way of knowing which ones are similar to each other.
Both of these problems can be solved by representing a categorical feature with an embedding
column. The idea is that each category has a smaller vector with, let’s say, 5 values in it. But unlike a one-hot vector, the values are not usually 0. The values are weights, similar to the weights that are used for basic features in a neural network. The difference is that each category has a set of weights (5 of them in this case).
You can think of each value in the embedding vector as a feature of the category. So, if two categories are very similar to each other, then their embedding vectors should be very similar too.
